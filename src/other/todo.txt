left click on bottom menu and units states:
if passive/notarget ability/command is pressed, state doesn't change
else the state changes depending on the clicked command/ability.

the state will then tell the main class which targets are valid for the current action (friend, enemy, structure, ground, etc)
so only the valid targets are targetable via left click and highlighted if mouse hovered 

next time left click is issued on the valid target, the coordinates  (or target unit) are sent to the unit
(state in the menu will change only if LMB is clicked on a valid target)
since unit knows which ability was being used, it will do that on the target location / target unit.
